Like Pathfinder had Sojourner, this website has a little robot valiantly working its way round the moon in real time. 

This rover is visiting all named features (except the satellite craters) at 20 kmph (ish - goes slower if there are lots of ups and downs on its route). 

The rover’s twitter feed tries to present a different view on the moon by showing the rover’s path side-on rather than top down - to give a better sense of the bumps and plains. This elevation data is extracted from the [LRO LOLA Elevation Model](http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/details/Moon/LRO/LOLA/Lunar_LRO_LOLA_Global_LDEM_118m_Mar2014/cub).
