##Privacy Policy

Hi there. This page basically says that we use Google Analytics to see who visits this website. To make sure we don't count you more than once as you roam around the site, Google Analytics drops a little text file (called a cookie) on your computer when you visit. It then uses this text file to see that you're the same person from earlier if you come back later. 

We don't pass information about you to third parties (except in the aggregate, for example "Wow! THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE READ OUR PRIVACY POLICY PAGE"). We don't know who you are, only that you've been to the website before.

If you want to opt-out of being counted by Google Analytics you can install a plugin Google built [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

If you sign up to our mailing list your personal information will be treated securely in accordance to data protection legislation - it will not be passed on to third parties and you will only be contacted with information related to the list you signed up for.
